<h2>Case Study Title: Social Media Feed with Infinite Scrolling</h2> 

<h3>Key Concepts :</h3>

<h4>##1. Implementing Infinite Scrolling in a React Component</h4>
<p1>
#   useState: To manage the state of the posts and loading status.
#   useEffect: To fetch initial data and trigger subsequent fetches based on scroll position.
#    useRef: To access DOM elements for scroll event listeners.
</p1>

<h5>##2. Fetching and Displaying Additional Posts</h5>
<p2>
#    The useEffect hook triggers the fetching of additional posts when the scroll position reaches the bottom of the container.
#   The fetched posts are appended to the existing posts state using the spread operator.
</p2>

<h6>##3. Optimizing Post Loading</h6>
<p3>
#   Pagination: Implement pagination to fetch posts in batches, reducing initial load times and improving performance.
#   Lazy Loading: Load images only when they come into view using libraries like react-lazy-load.
#   Caching: Cache fetched data to avoid unnecessary network requests.
</p3>

<h7>##4. Handling Loading States and Displaying a Spinner</h7>

<p4>
#  The isLoading state is used to control the display of a spinner while posts are being fetched.
#  The spinner is rendered within the SocialMediaFeed component.
</p4>
