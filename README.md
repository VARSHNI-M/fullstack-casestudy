# Case Study Title: Social Media Feed with Infinite Scrolling

#Key Concepts:
#1. Implementing Infinite Scrolling in a React Component
#   useState: To manage the state of the posts and loading status.
#   useEffect: To fetch initial data and trigger subsequent fetches based on scroll position.
#    useRef: To access DOM elements for scroll event listeners.

#2. Fetching and Displaying Additional Posts
#    The useEffect hook triggers the fetching of additional posts when the scroll position reaches the bottom of the container.
#   The fetched posts are appended to the existing posts state using the spread operator.

#3. Optimizing Post Loading
#   Pagination: Implement pagination to fetch posts in batches, reducing initial load times and improving performance.
#   Lazy Loading: Load images only when they come into view using libraries like react-lazy-load.
#   Caching: Cache fetched data to avoid unnecessary network requests.

#4. Handling Loading States and Displaying a Spinner
#  The isLoading state is used to control the display of a spinner while posts are being fetched.
#  The spinner is rendered within the SocialMediaFeed component.
